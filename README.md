Examples are to be found in the GAZL_fuselageFiles folder

and then, once completed, it can be copied, flipped and pasted into the upper right hand side base coat.  That way there is a pretty good chance that both sides will line up


Speaking of which, back in the layers section the **alignment** and **blue print** layers can be used to show the individual surfaces of the model and how they align. The main rotor gearbox fairing area is particularly tricky:

Look at the examples for help and inspiration . . .
